# IVR-Based Emergency Assistance & Hospital Locator

## Overview
IVR (Interactive Voice Response) Emergency Assistance is a voice-driven system that lets users access urgent medical help and hospital location services using any phone — including feature phones and landlines. For Cureon, this feature is designed to bridge connectivity and device gaps in rural areas where smartphones or stable mobile data may not be available.

## Key Capabilities
- Toll-free IVR number for immediate access: callers can dial a local toll-free number to reach the IVR system.
- Voice menu with language options: supports multiple regional languages and simple numeric keypad navigation for low-literacy users.
- SOS routing and escalation: when a caller selects emergency assistance, the system can identify the caller's approximate location (via cell tower data or caller input) and automatically route the request to nearby ambulances, emergency responders, or partnered hospitals.
- Hospital locator: callers can find the nearest hospitals, pharmacies, or clinics by entering a PIN code, speaking the district name, or allowing the system to infer location from the incoming number.
- Callback/bridging to human operators: when needed, IVR can connect callers to live operators or doctors via a phone bridge.
- SMS fallback: for users with intermittent data, the IVR can send confirmation SMS with directions, hospital contact details, and estimated travel time.

## Technical Approach (High-level)
- Telephony provider integration: integrate with providers like Twilio, Plivo, or local telecom carriers to host the IVR number and manage call flows.
- Language and TTS/ASR: use Text-to-Speech (TTS) for prompts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) where available; otherwise rely on DTMF (keypad) input for robust performance in low-bandwidth/low-device-capability scenarios.
- Location resolution: use a combination of caller input (PIN code), number-based geolocation (carrier data), and quick voice prompts to approximate the caller's location.
- Emergency routing engine: map caller location to the nearest emergency services, hospitals, or pharmacies using an internal geo-index and routing rules (distance, current availability, service type).
- Secure logging & callbacks: store minimal call metadata for follow-up while respecting privacy and compliance requirements; support secure callbacks to verify identity when necessary.

## Why this feature is especially valuable for Cureon
- Device and connectivity inclusivity: many rural users rely on feature phones or pay-as-you-go voice calls. IVR lets these users access emergency services without a smartphone or internet connection.
- Rapid response in low-resource settings: automatic SOS routing and hospital locator can shorten time-to-care by connecting callers to the nearest available resources quickly.
- Language and literacy accessibility: voice prompts and DTMF navigation make the service usable across multiple languages and by low-literacy populations.
- Resilience and redundancy: IVR provides a parallel, resilient channel when internet-based services (app, WebRTC) are unavailable due to network outages or low bandwidth.
- Integration with existing Cureon flows: IVR can be used to trigger callbacks to doctors, send appointment or prescription links via SMS, and link with the platform's patient records when identity is verified — creating an end-to-end experience that starts from a voice call and continues into the digital platform.

## Implementation notes and low-risk enhancements
- Start with a simple DTMF-first IVR (keypad menus) and add ASR/TTS later as budgets allow.
- Use a tiered routing approach: nearest public hospital → nearest private hospital → ambulance service → human operator.
- Add a short registration flow for frequent users so their medical profile and emergency contacts are available on repeat calls.
- Log anonymized call metadata and allow opt-in for linking calls to patient accounts for better continuity of care.

## Edge cases and mitigations
- Caller location unavailable: fallback to PIN code or district-name prompts; allow callers to provide landmarks.
- High call volume during crises: implement queueing, priority routing for repeat or registered users, and overflow to SMS with automated instructions.
- Language mismatch: offer a short-language-selection prompt and provide quick-repeat options in the selected language.

## Success criteria
- Call connection and routing working reliably across major carriers in target regions.
- Average time from call to dispatch <= target threshold (configurable per region).
- High user comprehension scores in local-language usability tests.

## Next steps
- Prototype a DTMF-first IVR flow using a telephony provider sandbox.
- Create an admin dashboard page to manage geo-indexed emergency endpoints and routing priorities.
- Pilot the IVR in one district and collect metrics (call volumes, successful dispatches, user feedback) before scaling.
