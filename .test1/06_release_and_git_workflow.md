## 1. Git Workflow Overview

Cureon follows a **feature branch workflow** where:
- Main development happens on the `main` (or `master`) branch
- New features are developed in separate feature branches
- Changes are merged back via Pull Requests (PRs)
- Production deployments are tagged releases

**Basic Flow:**
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes and commit frequently
3. Push branch to remote
4. Create Pull Request for review
5. After approval, merge to `main`
6. Delete feature branch

---

## 2. Branching Strategy

### Branch Types

**Main Branches:**
- `main` (or `master`) — Production-ready code
- `develop` — Integration branch for features (optional, if using Gitflow)

**Supporting Branches:**
- `feature/*` — New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/*` — Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` — Urgent production fixes
- `docs/*` — Documentation updates
- `test/*` — Testing or experimental changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens:

```
feature/appointment-reminders
feature/pharmacy-search
bugfix/prescription-pdf-layout
hotfix/jwt-token-expiry
docs/api-documentation
test/socket-io-performance
```

For this `.test1` documentation series, you've been using branch names like:
- `about`
- `architecture`
- `setup`
- `api_endpoint`
- `developer_note`

### Creating a New Branch (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Ensure you're on main and up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Or create from current branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

---

## 3. Commit Message Conventions

Follow the **Conventional Commits** specification for clear, structured commit messages.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body> (optional)

<footer> (optional)
```

### Types

- `feat` — New feature
- `fix` — Bug fix
- `docs` — Documentation changes
- `style` — Code style/formatting (no logic change)
- `refactor` — Code refactoring
- `test` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore` — Maintenance tasks (deps, configs)
- `perf` — Performance improvements
- `ci` — CI/CD changes

### Examples

**Good commit messages:**
```
feat(appointments): add appointment reminder system
fix(auth): resolve JWT token expiration issue
docs: update API endpoints documentation
refactor(pharmacy): simplify medicine search logic
test(user): add unit tests for user registration
chore(deps): upgrade React to v19
```

**Bad commit messages:**
```
fixed bug
updated files
changes
wip
asdfasdf
```

### Writing Good Commits

✅ **Do:**
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize first letter of subject
- Don't end subject with a period
- Use body to explain "what" and "why" (not "how")

❌ **Don't:**
- Use vague messages like "fix", "update", "changes"
- Commit unrelated changes together
- Include WIP (work-in-progress) commits in PRs

---

## 4. Creating and Pushing Commits

### Single File Commit (As You've Been Doing)

This is the approach you've been using for the `.test1` files:

```powershell
# Stage only the specific file
git add .test1/01_more_about_app.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: add .test1/01_more_about_app.md — project overview"

# Push to remote branch
git push origin <branch-name>

# Or set upstream and push
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
```

### Multiple Files Commit

```powershell
# Stage specific files
git add Backend/controller/reviewController.js
git add Backend/routes/reviewRoutes.js
git add Backend/models/reviewModel.js

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(reviews): add review system for doctors"

# Push
git push origin feature/review-system
```

### Stage All Changes

```powershell
# Stage all modified and new files
git add .

# Or stage all in a specific directory
git add Backend/

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(backend): complete pharmacy module implementation"

# Push
git push origin feature/pharmacy-module
```

### Checking Status Before Commit

```powershell
# View changed files
git status

# View detailed changes
git diff

# View staged changes
git diff --cached
```

### Amending Last Commit (If Not Pushed Yet)

```powershell
# Fix last commit message
git commit --amend -m "corrected message"

# Add forgotten files to last commit
git add forgotten-file.js
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Never amend commits that have already been pushed to a shared branch!

---

## 5. Pull Request Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch to remote:**
   ```powershell
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Go to GitHub repository:**
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/Prathameshk2024/Cureon`
   - Click "Pull requests" tab
   - Click "New pull request"

3. **Select branches:**
   - Base: `main` (or target branch)
   - Compare: `feature/my-feature` (your branch)

4. **Fill PR template:**

   ```markdown
   ## Description
   Brief description of what this PR does.

   ## Type of Change

   - [ ] Documentation update

   ## Changes Made
   - Added appointment reminder feature
   - Updated user model with new fields
   - Fixed bug in prescription generation

   ## Testing Done
   - [ ] Tested manually on local environment
   - [ ] All existing features still work

5. **Request reviewers** (if working in a team)

6. **Wait for review and address feedback**

### PR Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Keep PRs small and focused (one feature/fix per PR)
- Write clear PR description with context
- Link related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")
- Respond to review comments promptly
- Test thoroughly before requesting review

❌ **Don't:**
- Create massive PRs with 50+ file changes

## 8. Release Process

### Semantic Versioning

Cureon should follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

**Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)

- `MAJOR` — Breaking changes
- `MINOR` — New features (backward compatible)
- `PATCH` — Bug fixes (backward compatible)

**Examples:**
- `1.0.0` → Initial release
- `1.1.0` → Added pharmacy module
- `1.1.1` → Fixed prescription PDF bug
- `2.0.0` → Changed API authentication (breaking)

### Creating a Release

1. **Update version in `package.json`:**
   ```powershell
   cd Backend
   npm version patch   # or minor, or major
   cd ../Frontend
   npm version patch
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** (create if doesn't exist):
   ```markdown
   ## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-22

   ### Added
   - Appointment reminder system
   - Pharmacy search with filters
   - Medicine e-commerce module

   ### Fixed
   - Prescription PDF generation layout
   - JWT token expiration handling

   ### Changed
   - Updated React to v19
   - Improved error messages
   ```

3. **Commit version changes:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"
   ```

4. **Create Git tag:**
   ```powershell
   git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

5. **Create GitHub Release:**
   - Go to repository → Releases → "Draft a new release"
   - Select tag `v1.2.0`
   - Title: `Cureon v1.2.0`
   - Description: Copy from CHANGELOG
   - Publish release

6. **Deploy to production** (following deployment guide above)

### Hotfix Process

For urgent production fixes:

1. Create hotfix branch from `main`:
   ```powershell
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix
   ```

2. Make the fix and test thoroughly

3. Commit and push:
   ```powershell
   git commit -m "fix: resolve critical authentication bug"
   git push origin hotfix/critical-bug-fix
   ```

4. Create PR to `main` (expedited review)

5. After merge, immediately:
   - Bump patch version
   - Create tag
   - Deploy to production

6. Merge `main` back to `develop` (if using Gitflow)

## Summary: Your Six-File Workflow

Here's what you've accomplished with the `.test1` documentation:

| File | Branch | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `01_more_about_app.md` | `about` | Project overview and features |
| `02_architecture_overview.md` | `architecture` | System architecture and components |
| `03_setup_and_run.md` | `setup` | Setup instructions and troubleshooting |
| `04_api_endpoints.md` | `api_endpoint` | API reference documentation |
| `05_developer_notes.md` | `developer_note` | Coding conventions and guidelines |
| `06_release_and_git_workflow.md` | TBD | Git workflow and deployment |

**Your workflow for each file:**
1. Created feature branch
2. Added single file
3. Committed with clear message
4. Pushed to remote branch
5. (Presumably merged or will merge to main)

This is excellent practice for maintaining clean git history! 🎉

---

## Committing this file

To commit and push only this file (PowerShell):

```powershell
git add .test1/06_release_and_git_workflow.md
git commit -m "docs: add .test1/06_release_and_git_workflow.md — git and deployment guide"
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

Replace `<your-branch-name>` with your current branch (e.g., `workflow` or `git_workflow`).

---

## 🎊 Congratulations!

You've successfully created all six documentation files for Cureon! These files provide comprehensive guidance for:

1. Understanding the project
2. System architecture
3. Local setup and configuration
4. API integration
5. Development best practices
